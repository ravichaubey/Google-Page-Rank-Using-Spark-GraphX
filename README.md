GraphX provides pagerank algorithms. Pagerank means if important pages are linking to your website, you will be more important. This algorithm can be applied in situations other than websites too. For example, we can use pagerank algorithm to find the rank of various twitter handles.

The connected components algorithms provided by GraphX can be used to identify the clusters amongst your facebook friends.

The another important algorithm on Graphs is Triangle Counting. With this algorithms you can count the total triangles passing through each vertex. The counts of triangles is also a measure of clustering

The other algorithms such as Label Propagation, SVD++ and strongly connect components are also provided by graphx.

It provides the fundamental operators on graph such as subgraph, joinVertices, aggregateMessages and many more. Take a look at the API and programming guide for more details.
